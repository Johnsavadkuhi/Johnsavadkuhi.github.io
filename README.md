 The first step is running the below command : 

## yarn install  

 before yarn start the project you should run below command : 

## cd src/Style 

it is because in this project we use sass instead of node-sass, node-sass does not support @use and @forward rules and we use @use rule in this project 

after that run below command : 

 ## sass --watch mainwrap.scss  css/mainwrap.css
